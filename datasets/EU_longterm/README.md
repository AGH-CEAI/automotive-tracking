# WARNING!

The dataset is small for automotive data, but still rather large (94GB), hence the download may take considerable time. It is advisable to run the script with `nohup`, e.g.:

```bash
nohup get_files_EU.sh -all
```

To check possible download options, type
```bash
get_files_EU.sh --help
```
